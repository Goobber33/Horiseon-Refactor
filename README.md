# ‚≠ê Horiseon Refactor

#### The purpose of this project is to refactor the HTML and CSS files to make them more readable and accessible. This project aims to help my understanding of HTML Semantics, and how to properly build a functional CSS. 

'<div> <section> <header> <id> and <aside>. These are some semantic elements that I have come to understand during this project.'
